## Hi there 👋

I'm [Rizky](https://www.rizkyrahmansalam.my.id), a Fullstack Web Developer based in Indonesia.  

I’m passionate about building scalable web applications and crafting clean, maintainable code. I enjoy working on both the frontend and backend, turning ideas into fully functional digital products.

I work with html, css, javascript, typescript, react, tailwind, node.js, express.js, and golang. For databases, I use mysql, postgresql, and mongodb. I'm comfortable with git, github, rest api, docker, and CI/CD.  

I've got a bunch of pinned projects, but my favorite is the [taskflow](https://github.com/rizkythegreat/task-flow).

I've built over 40+ public repos, but privately.. it's probably more than 70 at this point.
